# GeocachingToolbox
A .NET library for interfacing geocaching services.

## Project status

The project is in a big technical debt - it's essentially a proof of concept with only simple features implemented, cutting some corners here and there. Before it's ready for a normal develompent (adding new features), some additional redesigning and refactoring must be done (see [Redesigning and refactoring](https://github.com/krzema12/GeocachingToolbox/wiki/Redesigning-and-refactoring)).

The next step for now is to arrange a meeting of the three contributors (or more, you're welcome!), somehow in January 2016. We will be able to discuss the tasks that need to be done, divide the work and talk about the plan for the next several months. The planned place of the meeting is Gdańsk, Poland. If someone not from Gdańsk is willing to join us, we can meet on Skype or something similar.
