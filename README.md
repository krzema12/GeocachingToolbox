# GeocachingToolbox
A .NET library for interfacing geocaching services.

## Project status

The project is in a big technical debt - it's essentially a proof of concept with only simple features implemented, cutting some corners here and there. Before it's ready for a normal develompent (adding new features), some additional redesigning and refactoring must be done (see [Redesigning and refactoring](https://github.com/krzema12/GeocachingToolbox/wiki/Redesigning-and-refactoring)).
